# double_pendulum_simulation
A small physics simulation for the notorious double pendulum.
The used equations can be derived from Lagrangian mechanics.
## settings
1. integration = The numerical integration method used: euler, leapfrog or runge-kutta.
2. all_energy = The option to graph either total energy of the system, or kinetic and potentially energy separately.
## current state
The collisions functionality is not working properly, the rest of the simulation is fine even though it doesn't preserve energy very well.
## requirements
See the requirements file.
